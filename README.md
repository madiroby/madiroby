- 👋 Hi, I’m @madiroby
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics and software development. Additionally, I would like to support the technological decentralization of governance and resource management.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things to keep track of seemlessly. C#, VB, SQL, XAML, Powershell, basic computer science.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment, my skills need refinement.
- 📫 How to reach me ... if you somehow find this email me at madison.b.roby@gmail.com. Not sure what you'd like to talk about, but if you would be so kind as to socialize with an inept freak such as myself go ahead.
